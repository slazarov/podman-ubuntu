# Test uncovered_binaries() — the pure set-diff helper at the heart of the
# packaging-completeness guardrail (scripts/verify_shipped_binaries.sh).
#
# The guardrail's DESTDIR walk and manifest parsing need an Ubuntu build host,
# but the diff logic is a pure string function. We sed-extract just that
# function body (from 'name()' to the first col-0 '}') and eval it, matching the
# extraction pattern used by test_detect_distro_depends.sh — so this test runs
# anywhere, including the macOS dev host.
