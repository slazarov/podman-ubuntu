## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- Phase 14-01: Switched conmon from `make podman` to `make install PREFIX=/usr` for proper DESTDIR support
- Phase 14-01: Used nFPM `type: tree` for glob-based directory inclusion (man pages, systemd units, completions)
- Phase 14-01: Pasta avx2 variants excluded from base nFPM config; orchestrator handles conditionally
- Phase 14-02: Used associative array for component-to-tag mapping rather than case statement
- Phase 14-02: Pasta version uses live date calculation matching build_pasta.sh pattern
- Phase 15-01: Used SignWith: yes instead of hardcoded fingerprint for GPG signing flexibility in CI
- Phase 15-01: Set Codename = Suite name (stable/edge) to avoid createsymlinks complexity
- Phase 15-01: Script exports public key from keyring if pubkey.gpg not yet committed
- Phase 15-02: Used Ed25519 algorithm for GPG key (smaller, faster, modern standard)
- Phase 15-02: Binary GPG public key format (not ASCII-armored) for APT signed-by compatibility
- Phase 16-01: Used curl -sfL with || true for graceful first-deploy handling (no live repo)
- Phase 16-01: Download other suite's .deb files to temp dir then add via reprepro includedeb
- Phase 18-01: Nightly versions use tilde (~git) convention for dpkg sort below tagged releases
- Phase 18-01: Pasta uses plain YYYYMMDD datestamp (no tilde) since already date-based
- Phase 18-01: extract_version_nightly is parallel code path, does not modify existing stable/edge functions
- Phase 18-01: git_checkout nightly mode detects default branch via git symbolic-ref with fallback to main
- Phase 18-02: Nightly env values inlined in workflow (not sourced from versions-nightly.env) to avoid sudo env sourcing complexity
- Phase 18-02: Removed redundant Set version tags step from build jobs (already handled inline in Build step)
- Phase 18-02: Go cache key uses track + run_number for better cache isolation between tracks

### Tech Debt
- Minor: install_dependencies.sh lacks DEBIAN_FRONTEND (relies on setup.sh)
- Minor: Circular sourcing pattern config.sh <-> functions.sh (guarded but fragile)

### Roadmap Evolution
- Phase 18 added: Edge Track: Build from Latest Upstream Commits

### Research Flags
- Phase 16: morph027/apt-repo-action import-from-repo-url multi-arch behavior needs validation
- Phase 17: pasta/passt date-based versioning and container-libs namespaced tags need specific parsing logic

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
