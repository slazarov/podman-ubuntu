# (Release, InRelease, Release.gpg, per-arch Packages/Release, by-hash/) and the
# pool entries it references straight into ${OUTPUT_DIR} with their ORIGINAL
# signatures, then exclude the suite from the re-includedeb/re-export loop
# (Step 4) and the by-hash + re-sign loop (Step 4b). Re-exporting an unchanged
# suite would regenerate its Release Date + signature even though its package
# content is identical, reopening the Acquire-By-Hash CDN hash-mismatch window
# this bolt-on exists to prevent. Serving the tree verbatim keeps the suite's
# Release Date / InRelease / Release.gpg byte-identical.
#
# VERBATIM_SUITES holds the non-target suites we successfully mirrored verbatim
# (the bare aliases on a 26.04 publish, plus any versioned non-target suite with
# a live tree). On a 24.04 publish the bare alias is a PUBLISH TARGET (D-12) so
# it is never in OTHER_SUITES and never verbatim-mirrored — it is fed fresh by
# repo_manage.sh exactly as before. When the live alias tree 404s (first deploy /
# empty-2604, D-14) the verbatim copy no-ops cleanly and the suite stays empty.

<p><em>Note:</em> The bare suite names <code>stable</code> and <code>nightly</code>
are <strong>deprecated</strong> and will be removed in a future release (the <code>v5</code>
track is distro-qualified only — always use <code>v5-2404</code> / <code>v5-2604</code>).

<p>3. Install:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install podman-suite</code></pre>
<p><code>podman-suite</code> is a meta-package that installs Podman and all its dependencies
(crun, conmon, netavark, aardvark-dns, pasta, buildah, skopeo, and more).</p>
