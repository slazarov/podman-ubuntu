#
# Downloads <url> into <dest> and tells "the file does not exist" apart from
# "the download did not work":
#
#   0  HTTP 200, the complete body is in <dest>
#   4  HTTP 404 or 410, the file is absent (nothing is written)
#   1  anything else after the retries ran out (nothing is written)
#
# curl errors (DNS, connect, TLS, a body shorter than its Content-Length)
# and HTTP 408, 429 and 5xx are retried up to FETCH_ATTEMPTS times, waiting
# FETCH_RETRY_DELAY seconds times the attempt number in between. Other HTTP
# codes fail at once. The body lands in a temporary file first, so <dest>
# never holds a partial download.
#
# Each request carries a throwaway query string and a no-cache header, so a
# CDN edge does not hand back a copy cached before the last deploy. GitHub
# Pages ignores the query string when it picks the file.
#
# file:// URLs are read straight from disk (the unit tests use them): a
# missing file is absent, anything unreadable is an error.

# ============================================
# Nightly revision checkpoint
# ============================================
#
# The nightly cron skips its build when nothing changed upstream. It compares
# each component's upstream HEAD with a checkpoint of the commits that were
# built AND deployed, per build cell. The checkpoint has one line per cell
# and component:
#
#   <cell> <component> <40-hex commit>
#
# where <cell> is <distro>-<arch> (2404-amd64). The two arch cells of a distro
# clone upstream separately, so they can build different commits; keying by
# cell keeps each one exact.
#
# A build cell records what it actually compiled (nightly_record_revisions).
# The publish job folds the records of the cells it deployed into the
# checkpoint (nightly_merge_revisions) and saves it only after the deploy
# and the propagation check succeeded. A cell that failed keeps its old
# entries, so the next nightly rebuilds it.

# component | clone directory under build/ | upstream repository
