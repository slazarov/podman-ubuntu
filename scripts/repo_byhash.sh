# ============================================
# Post-export Acquire-By-Hash support
# ============================================
#
# reprepro has no native Acquire-By-Hash support (Debian bug #820660), and
# GitHub Pages' CDN can serve a stale index alongside a fresh Release mid-deploy,
# producing apt hash-sum mismatches. After `reprepro export <suite>`, this helper:
#   1. materializes by-hash/<ALGO>/<hash> copies of every checksummed index
#      ADJACENT to that index, plus a by-hash copy of Release,
#   2. injects `Acquire-By-Hash: yes` into the suite's Release idempotently, and
#   3. re-signs InRelease (clearsign) + Release.gpg (detached). This is required
#      because editing Release after export invalidates reprepro's signatures.
#
# This helper does NOT re-import the GPG key; it relies on repo_manage.sh having
# already imported it into the keyring earlier in the publish.
#
# Every step checks its own result and the function returns 1 on the first
# failure, after it has printed the reason. It does not change the caller's
# shell options and installs no traps, so it behaves the same inside an `if`
# or `||` (where bash turns errexit off) as on its own. Callers must stop on
# a non-zero return: a suite whose Release was edited but not re-signed is
# unusable for apt.
#
# A listed index that does not exist on disk is skipped here (there is
# nothing to copy). verify_repo_integrity.sh fails the publish on it later.
