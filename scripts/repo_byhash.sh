# ============================================
#
# reprepro has no native Acquire-By-Hash support (Debian bug #820660), and
# GitHub Pages' CDN can serve a stale index alongside a fresh Release mid-deploy,
# producing apt hash-sum mismatches. After `reprepro export <suite>`, this helper:
#   1. materializes by-hash/<ALGO>/<hash> copies of every checksummed index
#      ADJACENT to that index (Pitfall 3), plus a by-hash copy of Release,
#   2. injects `Acquire-By-Hash: yes` into the suite's Release idempotently, and
#   3. re-signs InRelease (clearsign) + Release.gpg (detached) — mandatory (D-08),
#      because editing Release after export invalidates reprepro's signatures.
#
# This helper does NOT re-import the GPG key; it relies on repo_manage.sh having
# already imported it into the keyring earlier in the publish.

    # inside the by-hash loops (a missing listed index file, a transient awk/cp
    # error) must NOT abort the function after `rm -f InRelease Release.gpg`
    # (line below) but before the re-sign — that would publish a half-signed
    # (effectively unsigned) suite to GitHub Pages. Save the caller's exact
    # option set, drop errexit + pipefail locally, and install a single RETURN
    # trap as the sole restore point so the caller's options are restored on
    # EVERY return path (early `return 0`, normal end-of-function). The function
