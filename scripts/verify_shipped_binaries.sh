# verify_shipped_binaries.sh — packaging-completeness guardrail.
#
# Every packaging/nfpm/*.yaml cherry-picks explicit binary paths; nothing globs
# a whole bindir. So when an upstream project adds a new binary (as passt did
# with `pesto`), it is silently dropped from our .deb until a human notices.
# This check closes that gap: it diffs the binaries the build STAGED into
# DESTDIR against the binaries our manifests actually PACKAGE, and warns on any
# staged-but-unpackaged binary.
#
# It is deliberately NON-FATAL. A new upstream binary is a heads-up to update a
# manifest (and CLAUDE.local.md), not a reason to fail a build — package_all.sh
# invokes it with `|| true`. Run standalone the same way:
#
#   DESTDIR=/root/podman-staging ./scripts/verify_shipped_binaries.sh
#
# Matching is by install DESTINATION (manifest `dst:`), not by src glob, so a
# symlink entry like podmansh (src: podman) is still recognized as packaged.
# Only the binary trees are walked (usr/bin, usr/libexec/podman); man pages,
# completions, and config trees are out of scope.
